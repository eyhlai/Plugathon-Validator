","MedicationUse","A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. 

The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the person who administered the medication.  A medication statement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the medication statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.","The original comment on MedicationStatement present in FHIR R4 is incorrect and should not be taken into account while interpreting this profile (that comment has been removed in later FHIR releases).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"MedicationStatement",0,*,"","dom-2:If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT contain nested Resources {contained.contained.empty()}

","Extension","This StopType modifier extension works differently than the `.status` element of resources because it has a different meaning. The `.status` element usually represents the status of the resource at the moment of exchanging the resource. This means that over the lifetime of a resource, the status may change (and is very much related to use period). That – in itself – makes solely mapping StopType (which may never change in an instance) to `.status` not suitable.

For example: suppose you want the patient to stop taking medication definitively three days from today. This is a stop medication agreement with a StopType of _definitive_. However today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow the `.status` of this medication agreement is _active_ and only after the end date of the usage period the `.status` should be _stopped_. Status and StopType are simply not the same thing.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"DomainResource.modifierExtension",0,*,"ele-1

","DosingInstructions / InstructionsForUse","Instructions for the use of the medication, e.g. dose and route of administration. In the event of medication use, this is the pattern of use established by the patient or which the patient followed.","The dates included in the dosage on a Medication Statement reflect the dates for a given dose.  For example, ""from November 1, 2016 to November 3, 2016, take one tablet daily and from November 4, 2016 to November 7, 2016, take two tablets daily.""  It is expected that this specificity may only be populated where the patient brings in their labeled container or where the Medication Statement is derived from a MedicationRequest.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"MedicationStatement.dosage",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
