","Value of extension","Indicates that the timing as specified by `.frequency`, `.period` and `.periodUnit` should be strictly interpreted. This is the case when the zib concept Interval is expressed using these elements (as opposed to the zib concept Frequency).

The times can be chosen freely, but distribution throughout the day is more precise, and the interval between times is important (e.g. in the case of antibiotics). In the case of Baxter packs and intramural care, such a prescription is used to draw up a (location-specific) outline for distribution times (logistics).","Notes on the zib concepts Frequency and Interval:
1. An interval (in FHIR) is just a normal frequency of 1 (combined with a period based on the interval length) and is represented in FHIR as just another frequency using `.frequency` (set to 1), `.period` and `.periodUnit`. However, the zib differentiates between the two concepts in the timing precision (the Interval concept defines precise intervals while the Frequency concept defines approximate intervals). When the interval is precise, this is communicated using the extension in `.extension:timingExact`.
2. On the other hand, the zib Frequency concept might be used to express a single-use, non-repeating series by omitting the time unit. In FHIR, this is _not_ represented as a frequency, but with the `.count` element.
3. Lastly, the Frequency concept may be used to express either a single nominal value or a range. A range is represented by respectively setting the minimum and maximum value to `.frequency` and `.frequencyMax`, or to `.count` and `.countMax` for single-use events. A nominal value is expressed by setting its value to `.frequency` or to `.count` for single-use events, and leaving `.frequencyMax` and `.countMax` unpopulated.

In summary:
* zib concept Frequency:
    * With time unit:
        * Nominal value: `.frequency`, `.period` and `.periodUnit`
        * Range: `.frequency`, `.frequencyMax`, `.period` and `.periodUnit`
    * Without time unit:
        * Nominal value: `.count`
        * Range: `.count` and `.countMax`
* zib concept Interval: `.frequency` (set to 1), `.period`, `.periodUnit` and `.extension:timingExact` (set to _true_)","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Extension.value[x]",0,1,"ext-1

If `.frequencyMax` is present, this `.frequency`  element indicates the lower bound of the allowed range of the frequency.","Notes on the zib concepts Frequency and Interval, The zib differentiates between the two concepts in the specific usage of the extension `.extension:timingExact` and the element `.timeOfDay` combined:
1. The zib Interval (in FHIR) is just a normal frequency of 1 (combined with a period based on the interval length) and is represented in FHIR as just another frequency using `.frequency` (set to 1), `.period`, `.periodUnit`, the extension `.extension:timingExact` set to _true_ and the absence of the element `.timeOfDay`.
2. The zib Frequency concept might be used to express a single-use, non-repeating series by omitting the time unit. In FHIR, this is _not_ represented as a frequency, but with the `.count` element.
3. Lastly, the Frequency concept may be used to express either a single nominal value or a range. The extension `.extension:timingExact` can be used to specify the precision of the timing of the administration (i.e. the element `.timeOfDay`). When this element is meant to convey the zib Frequency concept this can be, unlike the zib concept Interval, either _true_or _false_. A range is represented by respectively setting the minimum and maximum value to `.frequency` and `.frequencyMax`, or to `.count` and `.countMax` for single-use events as mentioned in the second point. A nominal value is expressed by setting its value to `.frequency` or to `.count` for single-use events, and leaving `.frequencyMax` and `.countMax` unpopulated.

In summary:
* zib concept Frequency:
    * With time unit (precision of the timing can be further specified with the extension `.extension:timingExact`):
        * Nominal value: `.frequency`, `.period` and `.periodUnit`
        * Range: `.frequency`, `.frequencyMax`, `.period` and `.periodUnit`
    * Without time unit:
        * Nominal value: `.count`
        * Range: `.count` and `.countMax`
* zib concept Interval: `.frequency` (set to 1), `.period`, `.periodUnit`, `.extension:timingExact` (SHALL be set to _true_) and the absence of `.timeOfDay`.","","","If no frequency is stated, the assumption is that the event occurs once per period, but systems SHOULD always be specific about this","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Timing.repeat.frequency",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

The nominal value of the quantity.","Note that this specifies the quantity of the specified medication, not the quantity for each active ingredient(s). Each ingredient amount can be communicated in the Medication resource. For example, if one wants to communicate that a tablet was 375 mg, where the dose was one tablet, you can use the Medication resource to document that the tablet was comprised of 375 mg of drug XYZ. Alternatively if the dose was 375 mg, then you may only need to use the Medication resource to indicate this was a tablet. If the example were an IV such as dopamine and you wanted to communicate that 400mg of dopamine was mixed in 500 ml of some IV solution, then this would all be communicated in the Medication resource. If the administration is not intended to be instantaneous (rate is present or timing has a duration), this can be specified to convey the total amount to be administered over the period of time as indicated by the schedule e.g. 500 ml in dose, with timing used to convey that this should be done over 4 hours.","The amount of therapeutic or other substance given at one administration event.","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Dosage.doseAndRate.dose[x]",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

In practice, the measuring unit is almost always ml/hour, but can also be parametric with i.e. body weight or body surface area (in the case of a MedicationAgreement, VariableDosingRegimen or AdministrationAgreement). Entering an interval (such as 0-10 ml/hour) is also a commonly used option.

The rateQuantity approach requires systems to have the capability to parse UCUM grammer where ml/hour is included rather than a specific ratio where the time is specified as the denominator.
