This means that over the lifetime of a resource, the status may change (and is very much related to use period). That – in itself – makes solely mapping StopType (which may never change in an instance) to `.status` not suitable.

For example: suppose you want the patient to stop taking medication definitively three days from today. This is a stop medication agreement with a StopType of _definitive_. However today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow the `.status` of this medication agreement is _active_ and only after the end date of the usage period the `.status` should be _stopped_.

","Value of extension","Indicates that the timing as specified by `.frequency`, `.period` and `.periodUnit` should be strictly interpreted. This is the case when the zib concept Interval is expressed using these elements (as opposed to the zib concept Frequency).

The times can be chosen freely, but distribution throughout the day is more precise, and the interval between times is important (e.g. in the case of antibiotics). In the case of Baxter packs and intramural care, such a prescription is used to draw up a (location-specific) outline for distribution times (logistics).","Notes on the zib concepts Frequency and Interval:
1. An interval (in FHIR) is just a normal frequency of 1 (combined with a period based on the interval length) and is represented in FHIR as just another frequency using `.frequency` (set to 1), `.period` and `.periodUnit`. However, the zib differentiates between the two concepts in the timing precision (the Interval concept defines precise intervals while the Frequency concept defines approximate intervals). When the interval is precise, this is communicated using the extension in `.extension:timingExact`.
2. On the other hand, the zib Frequency concept might be used to express a single-use, non-repeating series by omitting the time unit. In FHIR, this is _not_ represented as a frequency, but with the `.count` element.
3. Lastly, the Frequency concept may be used to express either a single nominal value or a range. A range is represented by respectively setting the minimum and maximum value to `.frequency` and `.frequencyMax`, or to `.count` and `.countMax` for single-use events. A nominal value is expressed by setting its value to `.frequency` or to `.count` for single-use events, and leaving `.frequencyMax` and `.countMax` unpopulated.

In summary:

    * With time unit:
        * Nominal value: `.frequency`, `.period` and `.periodUnit`
        * Range: `.frequency`, `.frequencyMax`, `.period` and `.periodUnit`

1.

2. The zib Frequency concept might be used to express a single-use, non-repeating series by omitting the time unit. In FHIR, this is _not_ represented as a frequency, but with the `.count` element.
3. Lastly, the Frequency concept may be used to express either a single nominal value or a range. The extension `.extension:timingExact` can be used to specify the precision of the timing of the administration (i.e. the element `.timeOfDay`). When this element is meant to convey the zib Frequency concept this can be, unlike the zib concept Interval, either _true_or _false_. A range is represented by respectively setting the minimum and maximum value to `.frequency` and `.frequencyMax`, or to `.count` and `.countMax` for single-use events as mentioned in the second point. A nominal value is expressed by setting its value to `.frequency` or to `.count` for single-use events, and leaving `.frequencyMax` and `.countMax` unpopulated.

Where a rate such as 500ml over 2 hours is specified, the use of rateRatio may be more semantically correct than specifying using a rateQuantity of 250 mg/hour.","Identifies the speed with which the medication was or will be introduced into the patient. Typically the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1 hour or 100 ml/hr.  May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time e.g. 500 ml per 2 hours.   Other examples: 200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours.  Sometimes, a rate can imply duration when expressed as total volume / duration (e.g.  500mL/2 hours implies a duration of 2 hours).  However, when rate doesn't imply duration (e.g. 250mL/hour), then the timing.repeat.duration is needed to convey the infuse over time period.","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Logical reference, when literal reference is not known","An identifier for the target resource. This is used when there is no way to reference the other resource directly, either because the entity it represents is not available through a FHIR server, or because there is no way for the author of the resource to convert a known identifier to an actual location. There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.","When an identifier is provided in place of a reference, any system processing the reference will only be able to resolve the identifier to a reference if it understands the business context in which the identifier is used. Sometimes this is global (e.g. a national identifier) but often it is not. For this reason, none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g. chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able resolve the reference. Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy. 

When both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred. Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check that the identifier matches the literal reference

Applications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical reference present, or remove it.

Reference is intended to point to a structure that can potentially be expressed as a FHIR resource, though there is no need for it to exist as an actual FHIR resource instance - except in as much as an application wishes to actual find the target of the reference. The content referred to be the identifier must meet the logical constraints implied by any limitations on what resource types are permitted for the reference.  For example, it would not be legitimate to send the identifier for a drug prescription if the type were Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport).  One of the use-cases for Reference.identifier is the situation where no FHIR representation exists (where the type is Reference (Any).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Reference.identifier",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.","When an identifier is provided in place of a reference, any system processing the reference will only be able to resolve the identifier to a reference if it understands the business context in which the identifier is used. Sometimes this is global (e.g. a national identifier) but often it is not. For this reason, none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g. chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able resolve the reference. Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy. 

When both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred. Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check that the identifier matches the literal reference

Applications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical reference present, or remove it.

Reference is intended to point to a structure that can potentially be expressed as a FHIR resource, though there is no need for it to exist as an actual FHIR resource instance - except in as much as an application wishes to actual find the target of the reference. The content referred to be the identifier must meet the logical constraints implied by any limitations on what resource types are permitted for the reference.  For example, it would not be legitimate to send the identifier for a drug prescription if the type were Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport).  One of the use-cases for Reference.identifier is the situation where no FHIR representation exists (where the type is Reference (Any).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Reference.identifier",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

* message : the date that the content of the message was assembled. This date is not changed by middleware engines unless they add additional data that changes the meaning of the time of the message
* history : the date that the history was assembled. This time would be used as the _since time to ask for subsequent updates

This is used when there is no way to reference the other resource directly, either because the entity it represents is not available through a FHIR server, or because there is no way for the author of the resource to convert a known identifier to an actual location. There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.","When an identifier is provided in place of a reference, any system processing the reference will only be able to resolve the identifier to a reference if it understands the business context in which the identifier is used. Sometimes this is global (e.g. a national identifier) but often it is not. For this reason, none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g. chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able resolve the reference. Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy. 

When both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred. Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check that the identifier matches the literal reference

Applications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical reference present, or remove it.

Reference is intended to point to a structure that can potentially be expressed as a FHIR resource, though there is no need for it to exist as an actual FHIR resource instance - except in as much as an application wishes to actual find the target of the reference. The content referred to be the identifier must meet the logical constraints implied by any limitations on what resource types are permitted for the reference.  For example, it would not be legitimate to send the identifier for a drug prescription if the type were Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport).  One of the use-cases for Reference.identifier is the situation where no FHIR representation exists (where the type is Reference (Any).","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Reference.identifier",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

Usage:

* document : the date the document was created. Note: the composition may predate the document, or be associated with multiple documents. The date of the composition - the authoring time - may be earlier than the document assembly time
* message : the date that the content of the message was assembled. This date is not changed by middleware engines unless they add additional data that changes the meaning of the time of the message
* history : the date that the history was assembled. This time would be used as the _since time to ask for subsequent updates
* searchset : the time that the search set was assembled. Note that different pages MAY have different timestamps but need not. Having different timestamps does not imply that subsequent pages will represent or include changes made since the initial query
* transaction | transaction-response | batch | batch-response | collection : no particular assigned meaning

","MedicationUse","A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. 

The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the person who administered the medication.  A medication statement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the medication statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.

","Extension","This StopType modifier extension works differently than the `.status` element of resources because it has a different meaning. The `.status` element usually represents the status of the resource at the moment of exchanging the resource. This means that over the lifetime of a resource, the status may change (and is very much related to use period). That – in itself – makes solely mapping StopType (which may never change in an instance) to `.status` not suitable.

For example: suppose you want the patient to stop taking medication definitively three days from today. This is a stop medication agreement with a StopType of _definitive_. However today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow the `.status` of this medication agreement is _active_ and only after the end date of the usage period the `.status` should be _stopped_. Status and StopType are simply not the same thing.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"DomainResource.modifierExtension",0,*,"ele-1

Applications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical reference present, or remove it.

Reference is intended to point to a structure that can potentially be expressed as a FHIR resource, though there is no need for it to exist as an actual FHIR resource instance - except in as much as an application wishes to actual find the target of the reference.

For example, it would not be legitimate to send the identifier for a drug prescription if the type were Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport).

","MedicationCode","Coding medication in the Netherlands is done on the basis of the G-standaard (issued by Z-index), which is filled under the direction of Royal Dutch Pharmacists Association (KNMP).

The coded medication can be expressed as:

* ZI number
* Trade product code (HPK)
* Prescription code (PRK)
* Generic product code (GPK)

The ZI number represents the trade product and the package size.
The HPK is the trade product as registered and marketed by the manufacturer.
The PRK contains all GPK information supplemented with information needed to prescribe the right product. This level is intended to facilitate generic prescription of drugs.
The GPK defines the pharmaceutical characteristics of a product: ingredients, strengths, units, pharmaceutical form and route of administration.

Further information about the G-Standaard levels see <https://www.z-index.nl>.

So-called 90.000.000 numbers are used in local IT systems. The 90.000.000 number is used in accordance with national agreements.","Depending on the context of use, the code that was actually selected by the user (prescriber, dispenser, etc.) will have the `.coding.userSelected` set to _true_.  As described in the coding datatype: ""A coding may be marked as a ""userSelected"" if a user selected the particular coded value in a user interface (e.g. the user selects an item in a pick-list). If a user selected coding exists, it is the preferred choice for performing translations etc. Other codes can only be literal translations to alternative code systems, or codes at a lower level of granularity (e.g. a generic code for a vendor-specific primary one).
If there is no coding available, it is preferred to omit this `.coding` element.

Usage:

* document : the date the document was created. Note: the composition may predate the document, or be associated with multiple documents. The date of the composition - the authoring time - may be earlier than the document assembly time
* message : the date that the content of the message was assembled. This date is not changed by middleware engines unless they add additional data that changes the meaning of the time of the message
* history : the date that the history was assembled. This time would be used as the _since time to ask for subsequent updates
* searchset : the time that the search set was assembled. Note that different pages MAY have different timestamps but need not. Having different timestamps does not imply that subsequent pages will represent or include changes made since the initial query
* transaction | transaction-response | batch | batch-response | collection : no particular assigned meaning

That – in itself – makes solely mapping StopType (which may never change in an instance) to `.status` not suitable.

For example: suppose you want the patient to stop taking medication definitively three days from today. This is a stop medication agreement with a StopType of _definitive_. However today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow the `.status` of this medication agreement is _active_ and only after the end date of the usage period the `.status` should be _stopped_.
