","Extension","This StopType modifier extension works differently than the `.status` element of resources because it has a different meaning. The `.status` element usually represents the status of the resource at the moment of exchanging the resource. This means that over the lifetime of a resource, the status may change (and is very much related to use period). That – in itself – makes solely mapping StopType (which may never change in an instance) to `.status` not suitable.

For example: suppose you want the patient to stop taking medication definitively three days from today. This is a stop medication agreement with a StopType of _definitive_. However today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow the `.status` of this medication agreement is _active_ and only after the end date of the usage period the `.status` should be _stopped_.

* When PeriodOfUse.Duration and PeriodOfUse.startDateTime are known, PeriodOfUse.endDateTime can be deduced and the previous rules apply.
